# 2D LBM Demonstration

A repository for the January, 2023 LBM Workshop for Digital Porous Media Industrial Affiliates Program (DPM IAP) members.

This repository contains part 1 of the hands-on activity. Part 2 uses a fork of [MPLBM-UT](https://github.com/BC-Chang/MPLBM-UT) and is conducted using Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) resources.

In this part of the hands-on activity, we will demonstrate a general LBM simulation algorithm with a D2Q9 solver. Some example domains that have been tested can be found in the data directory.
